Lower airway slowly adapting receptors have been proposed to have a permissive effect on the cough reflex. We hypothesized that vagotomy below the recurrent laryngeal nerve branch would depress mechanically or chemically induced cough. In anesthetized, bilaterally thoracotomized, artificially ventilated cats, thoracic vagotomy nearly eliminated cough induced by mechanical stimulation of the intrathoracic airway, significantly depressed mechanically stimulated laryngeal cough, and eliminated capsaicin-induced cough. These results support an important role of lower airway sensory feedback in the production of tracheobronchial and laryngeal cough in the cat. Further, at least some of this feedback is due to excitation from pulmonary volume-sensitive sensory receptors.","tags":[],"title":"Influence of Intrathoracic Vagotomy on the Cough Reflex in the Anesthetized Cat","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1631383200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631383200,"objectID":"cc4708f6a2ccc2e3d9b5dc54a4334575","permalink":"https://nickmusselwhite.github.io/talk/basic-science-and-speech-language-pathology/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/basic-science-and-speech-language-pathology/","section":"event","summary":"Basic science research as it pertains to speech language pathology students","tags":null,"title":"Basic Science and Speech Language Pathology","type":"event"},{"authors":["M.

We hypothesized that cerebellectomy would disinhibit motor drive to respiratory muscles during cough. Cough was induced by mechanical stimulation of the tracheobronchial airways in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing adult cats (8 male, 1 female), and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from upper airway, chest wall, and abdominal respiratory muscles. Cough trials were performed before and at two time points after total cerebellectomy (10 minutes and \\textgreater1 hour). Unlike a prior report in paralyzed, decerebrated, and artificially ventilated animals, we observed that cerebellectomy had no effect on cough frequency. After cerebellectomy, thoracic inspiratory muscle EMG magnitudes increased during cough (diaphragm EMG increased by 14\\% at 10 minutes, p = 0.04; parasternal by 34\\% at 10 minutes and by 32\\% at \\textgreater1 hour, p = 0.001 and 0.03 respectively). During cough at 10 minutes after cerebellectomy, inspiratory esophageal pressure was increased by 44\\% (p = 0.004), thyroarytenoid (laryngeal adductor) muscle EMG amplitude increased 13\\% (p = 0.04), and no change was observed in the posterior cricoarytenoid (laryngeal abductor) EMG. Cough phase durations did not change. Blood pressure and heart rate were reduced after cerebellectomy, and respiratory rate also decreased due to an increase in duration of the expiratory phase of breathing. Changes in cough-related EMG magnitudes of respiratory muscles suggest that the cerebellum exerts inhibitory control of cough motor drive, but not cough number or phase timing in response to mechanical stimuli in this model early after cerebellectomy. However, results varied widely at \\textgreater1 hour after cerebellectomy, with some animals exhibiting enhancement or suppression of one or more components of the cough motor behavior. These results suggest that, while the cerebellum and behavior-related sensory feedback regulate cough, it may be difficult to predict the nature of the modulation based on total cerebellectomy.","tags":[],"title":"Differential effects of acute cerebellectomy on cough in spontaneously breathing cats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tabitha Y Shen","Ivan Poliacek","Melanie J.

Neuronal populations in the pre-Bötzinger complex (PreBötC) represent a substantial component for respiratory rhythmogenesis. We studied the role of PreBötC neuronal excitation and inhibition on mechanically induced tracheobronchial cough in 15 spontaneously breathing, pentobarbital anesthetized adult cats (35 mg/kg i.v. initially). Neuronal excitation by unilateral microinjection of glutamate analog D,L-homocysteic acid resulted in mild reduction of cough abdominal electromyogram (EMG) amplitudes and very limited temporal changes of cough compared to effects on breathing (very high respiratory rate, high amplitude inspiratory bursts with a short inspiratory phase and tonic inspiratory motor component). Mean arterial blood pressure temporarily decreased. Blocking glutamate related neuronal excitation by bilateral microinjections of non-specific glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid reduced cough inspiratory and expiratory EMG amplitude and shortened most cough temporal characteristics similarly to breathing temporal characteristics. Respiratory rate decreased and blood pressure temporarily increased. Limiting active neuronal inhibition by unilateral and bilateral microinjections of GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine resulted in lower cough number, reduced expiratory cough efforts, and prolongation of cough temporal features and breathing phases (with lower respiratory rate). The PreBötC is important for cough motor pattern generation. Excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission in the PreBötC is involved in control of cough intensity and patterning. GABAA receptor related inhibition in the PreBötC strongly affects breathing and coughing phase durations in the same manner, as well as cough expiratory efforts. In conclusion, differences in effects on cough and breathing are consistent with separate control of these behaviors.","tags":[],"title":"The Role of Neuronal Excitation and Inhibition in the Pre-Bötzinger Complex on the Cough Reflex in the Cat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nick Musselwhite, PhD","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Electromyograms (EMGs) of diaphragm (DIA) and abdominal muscles (ABD), blood pressure and esophageal pressure (EP) were recorded and analysed. Bilateral microinjections of 1 mM GABA (total 66 ± 4 nl), 1 mM baclofen (64 ± 4 nl) and unilateral microinjections of 0.5 mM muscimol (33 ± 1 nl) in the rNTS significantly reduced cough number (CN), amplitudes of ABD EMGs, expiratory EP, and prolonged the duration of the cough inspiratory phase. GABA microinjections decreased the amplitudes of cough-related DIA EMGs and inspiratory EP; muscimol microinjections decreased the cough DIA EMG on the contralateral side. Only microinjections of GABA into the cNTS suppressed CN. In some cases, microinjections prolonged the inspiratory phase, lowered respiratory rate, changed the depth of breathing, and increased blood pressure and heart rate. Our results confirm that GABA-ergic inhibitory mechanisms in the rNTS can regulate coughing in the anesthetized cat.","tags":[],"title":"GABA-ergic neurotransmission in the nucleus of the solitary tract modulates cough in the cat","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://nickmusselwhite.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
